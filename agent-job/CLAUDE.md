# agent-job/ — Agent Job Configuration

This directory contains your agent job configuration files — system prompts, scheduling, and self-monitoring.

## Files

- **`SOUL.md`** — Agent personality, identity, and values. Included in every agent job system prompt.
- **`SYSTEM.md`** — Runtime environment documentation injected into the agent's context.
- **`HEARTBEAT.md`** — Prompt for the agent's periodic heartbeat cron job.
- **`CRONS.json`** — Scheduled job definitions, loaded at server startup.

## Editing CRONS.json

`CRONS.json` is a JSON array of cron job objects. Each entry needs a `name`, `schedule` (cron expression), `type`, and `enabled` flag.

There are three action types:

**`agent`** — Launches a Docker agent container to execute an LLM task.

```json
{
  "name": "heartbeat",
  "schedule": "*/30 * * * *",
  "type": "agent",
  "job": "Read agent-job/HEARTBEAT.md and complete the tasks described there.",
  "enabled": false
}
```

Optional: add `"llm_provider"` and `"llm_model"` to override the default LLM for that job.

**`command`** — Runs a shell command on the event handler (working directory: project root).

```json
{
  "name": "ping",
  "schedule": "*/1 * * * *",
  "type": "command",
  "command": "echo \"pong!\"",
  "enabled": true
}
```

**`webhook`** — Makes an HTTP request. `POST` (default) sends `vars` as the body; `GET` skips the body.

```json
{
  "name": "health-check",
  "schedule": "*/10 * * * *",
  "type": "webhook",
  "url": "https://example.com/health",
  "method": "GET",
  "enabled": false
}
```

Optional webhook fields: `"method"` (default `POST`), `"headers"`, `"vars"`.
