# Project Structure

This is a [thepopebot](https://github.com/stephengpope/thepopebot) project.

## Directories

- **`agent-job/`** — Agent job configuration: system prompts (`SOUL.md`, `SYSTEM.md`), heartbeat prompt, and cron schedules (`CRONS.json`).
- **`agents/`** — Custom agent definitions. Each subdirectory defines an agent (see Managing Agents below).
- **`event-handler/`** — Event handler configuration: chat system prompts, trigger definitions (`TRIGGERS.json`), cluster templates, and LiteLLM proxy config.
- **`skills/library/`** — Skill plugins. Activate by symlinking into `skills/active/`.
- **`data/`** — Runtime data (SQLite database, cluster state). Not checked into git.
- **`logs/`** — Agent job logs, organized by job ID. Not checked into git.

## Files

- **`docker-compose.yml`** — Container definitions for the event handler and LiteLLM proxy. Managed — do not edit.
- **`docker-compose.custom.yml`** — Your Docker Compose overrides. Merged with the main compose file.
- **`.env`** — Environment variables (API keys, secrets). Never committed to git.

## Managed Files

Some files are auto-synced by `npx thepopebot init` and will be overwritten on upgrade. Do not edit these:

- `.github/workflows/` — CI/CD workflows
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.dockerignore`
- `.gitignore`
- `agent-job/CLAUDE.md`
- `agents/CLAUDE.md`
- `event-handler/CLAUDE.md`
- `skills/CLAUDE.md`
